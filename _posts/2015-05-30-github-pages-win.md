## Overview
In this article I setup a Windows environment to run [Jekyll][jek] to
support a [GitHub Pages][pages] environment.

## References 
[github]: https://github.com "GitHub"
[pages]: https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages"
[jek]: http://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll"
[winjek]: http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com "Run Jekyll on Windows"

1. [Run Jekyll on Windows][winjek]
1. [Jekyll][jek]
1. [GitHub Pages][pages]

## Tasks

The tasks are actually pretty simple here, just follow the instructions
provided by [Run Jekyll on Windows][winjek] to set up Jekyll and the instructions on [GitHub Pages][pages] to it up.  Although I am still working
may way through the issue with UTF-8 and Bundler :( the instructions get you
up and running.

Roughly this consists of:

1. Setting up Ruby
1. Setting up Ruby DevKit
1. Setting up Jekyll
1. Making any changes specific to Windows
1. Setting up your GitHub pages.
