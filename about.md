# About
I am writing here to record my configurations for various tools that I use.  I
am mostly writing for myself, but hope that others may find the information
here useful.

The theme for this website is [Bitwiser](http://bitwiser.in/bitwiser/). A [demo
site](http://bitwiser.in/bitwiser/demo.html) is available.

## About Me
I was trained as a programmer at the ANU.  While studying the computing
resources progressively got more and more difficult to access and so some of my
friends and I started to investigate Linux.  Since starting this investigation
I have configured Linux boxes (Debian mostly) for quite a range of things.

I have also moved from programming into management/architecture, but still have
a strong interested in development and maintaining my own development
environment.
